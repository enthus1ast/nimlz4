#
#LZ4_compress_default() :
#    Compresses 'sourceSize' bytes from buffer 'source'
#    into already allocated 'dest' buffer of size 'maxDestSize'.
#    Compression is guaranteed to succeed if 'maxDestSize' >= LZ4_compressBound(sourceSize).
#    It also runs faster, so it's a recommended setting.
#    If the function cannot compress 'source' into a more limited 'dest' budget,
#    compression stops *immediately*, and the function result is zero.
#    As a consequence, 'dest' content is not valid.
#    This function never writes outside 'dest' buffer, nor read outside 'source' buffer.
#        sourceSize  : Max supported value is LZ4_MAX_INPUT_VALUE
#        maxDestSize : full or partial size of buffer 'dest' (which must be already allocated)
#        return : the number of bytes written into buffer 'dest' (necessarily <= maxOutputSize)
#              or 0 if compression fails
#
#LZ4_decompress_safe() :
#    compressedSize : is the precise full size of the compressed block.
#    maxDecompressedSize : is the size of destination buffer, which must be already allocated.
#    return : the number of bytes decompressed into destination buffer (necessarily <= maxDecompressedSize)
#             If destination buffer is not large enough, decoding will stop and output an error code (<0).
#             If the source stream is detected malformed, the function will stop decoding and return a negative result.
#             This function is protected against buffer overflow exploits, including malicious data packets.
#             It never writes outside output buffer, nor reads outside input buffer.
